# Discord Modeling Challenge Bot

Limitations:
Blender only
This bot allows renders blend files so it shouldn't be used where its users are untrusted as a bad blend file could crash a system and perhaps worse. it could be adapted to accept images or video instead of blend files
The bot is also set up to target a specific discord server
