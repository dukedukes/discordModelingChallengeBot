# Discord Modeling Challenge Bot

Limitations:

Blender only

This bot allows rendering blend files so it shouldn't be used where its users are untrusted as a bad blend file could crash a system and perhaps worse. it could be adapted to accept images or video instead of blend files

The bot is also set up to target a specific discord server

Rendering depends on proper blend file settings, there is a template file associated with this project (not included) which produces a video containing a 360 spin of the modeled object with the parameters in the appsettings.json file
